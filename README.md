Extracting Business card
To run the Streamlit application along with the required functionalities (such as SQLite, EasyOCR, and other dependencies), here is the list of required Python libraries you need to install:

Required Python Libraries:
Streamlit: The main library for creating the web app interface.
Streamlit-Option-Menu: For the sidebar menu in the Streamlit app.
EasyOCR: For extracting text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
Pillow: For opening and displaying images.
Pandas: For working with DataFrames and displaying the data in tabular format.
SQLite3: For interacting with the SQLite database.
NumPy: For image data manipulation.
To Install the Required Libraries:
pip install streamlit streamlit-option-menu easyocr pillow pandas numpy

These are the essential libraries you need. However, SQLite3 is part of the standard Python library, so no installation is needed for that.

Summary of Requirements:
streamlit: Used to build the web app interface.
streamlit-option-menu: To create a sidebar with options for the app navigation.
easyocr: To handle Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for extracting text from images.
pillow: For image handling and displaying.
pandas: To manage tabular data, especially for displaying records from the database.
numpy: Used for array manipulation (especially for handling image data).
sqlite3: SQLite is a built-in library, so no need for installation; it's used for storing the extracted data.
Once these libraries are installed, you should be able to run the Streamlit app and interact with it as expected! Let me know if you need help setting up or running the application.
